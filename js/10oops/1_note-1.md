# js=>prototype-based language
# developers can use classes to create objects

# Object
- collection of properties and methods
- properties:- variables declared directly in class/struct(length)
- methods:- functions associated with class(toLowerCase)

# parts of object oriented programing
- object literal
- constructor function(for multiple instances of same object)
- prototype
- classes
- instances(new,this)

# 4 pillars of oops
- abstraction(hiding the implementation details of an object)
- encapsulation(rapping)
- inheritance(create a new class based on an existing class)
- polymorphism(dynamic method dispatch)
